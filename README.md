## Getting Started

### Requirements
These software components are needed on your platform to run this ROS node.

- [ROS](https://www.ros.org/): tested with [ROS noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation)

### Prerequisites

1. Create a catkin workspace and install [catkin_tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html)
    ```[bash]
    mkdir -p catkin_ws/src && cd catkin_ws
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-catkin-tools
    catkin init
    catkin config --extend /opt/ros/$(rosversion -d) --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -j4 -l4
    ```
1. Clone the required ROS packeges to your workspace
    ```[bash]
    cd src
    git clone git@gitlab.aau.at:aau-cns/evb1000_driver.git
    git clone git@gitlab.aau.at:aau-cns/ros_pkgs/amaze_mission_sequencer.git
    git clone git@gitlab.aau.at:aau-cns/ros_pkgs/uwb_init_cpp.git
    ```

### Build

1. Compile using `catkin build`:
    ```[bash]
    cd catkin_ws/src && catkin build uwb_init_cpp
    ```

## Usage

This rosnode can be launched with the provided launchfile by running

```[bash]
roslaunch uwb_init_cpp uwb_init.launch
```

### Initialization Methods
This node is able to initialize the anchor positions including the measurement bias in various different formulations, using either a single or two measurements.

#### Method
The initialization method is set by the parameter `init_method`.

##### `SINGLE`
Uses only a single measurement in the formulation. This method performs slightly worse, as the problem for bias and anchor position differs in several order of magnitudes.

##### `DOUBLE`
Uses a pair of measurements at least `meas_baseline_idx` idices apart (in the buffer) and at least `meas_baseline_m` meters in measurement distance difference. This method performs better, as it keeps the problem in the same order of magnitude.

#### Variables
Various different variables can be initialized with this node, chosen by the `init_variables` parameter.

| Symbol                                            | Description                             |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_m)     | anchor measurement                      |
| ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z)       | actual distance between anchor and tag  |
| ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\alpha)  | distance dependent bias                 |
| ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\gamma)  | constant bias                           |

It should be noted that the actual distance between the tag and anchor uses the current tag position *p* to incorporate the unknown anchor position *q* in this formulation. I.e.

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z^2=(p-q)^2)

##### `FULL_BIAS`
Initialize all unknown variables and biases with the measurement equation

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_m=(1+\alpha)z+\gamma)

##### `NO_BIAS`
Initialize the anchor position using no bias with the measurement equation

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_m=z)

##### `CONST BIAS`
Initialize the anchor position using only a constant bias with the measurement equation

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_m=z+\gamma)

*This performance is untested inflight.*

##### `CONST BIAS`
Initialize the anchor position using only a distance-dependent bias with the measurement equation

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?z_m=(1+\alpha)z)

*This performance is untested inflight.*

### Common  Issues with Initialization
This UWB initialization node's success highly depends on the path flown and quality of the measurements received.  The standard parameters are tuned for the TREK1000 UWB modules, for which the original version of this code is released for. Hence it might be relevant to adjust some parameters (see [launch parameters](#launch-parameters)) to run this node with your modules successfully.

#### Failure: LLS condition number
This failure is common if the condition number of the LLS problem does not get lower. Try to accumulate more distinctive data by flying more random trajectories and try to gather anchor measurements from far and close to the anchor, if possible. If this does not help, increase the `max_cond_number` parameter.

#### Falure: COV SVD threshold
We added a check on the covariance matrix condition number to check for the quality of the initialization. In general, the more data, the lower the covariance matrix condition number of the solution, the better the solution. Thus try to accumulate more data. This parameter (`cov_sv_threshold`) is fine tuned, increasing it by as much as `5e-4` might change the whole initialization process (in quality and duration).

### Launch Parameters
The provided launchfile and node allows the setting of the following parameters. Each of these parameters can either be set in the launchfile, set through other launchfiles by using the `<include>` and `<arg>` tags, or set through the command line with `roslaunch uwb_init_cpp uwb_init.launch <PARAMETER>:=<VALUE>`.
